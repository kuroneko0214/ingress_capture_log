# Ingrex


## DESCRPTION
Fetch the comm log within a specific area, and logging the capture information.
Thanks for the ingrex_lib project(https://github.com/blackgear/ingrex_lib). 

## NOTE
Since NIA has removed the guardian, this program is closed. Use the scripts inside the program has risk of been terminated by NIA. Please be caution.


## INTRODUCTION
1. refreshPortal.py

    Use Linux crontab to refresh portal's owner and team every 30 minutes. 

2. refreshCookies.py

    Specify your ingress account, and get the latest SACSID. You can use Linux crontab to refresh the cookies timely.

3. calculateTilekeys.py

    Calculate tilekeys for the newly added portals. And wait for being refreshed by field.py.

4. comm.py

    Fetch comm log within a specific area. Refresh the portal details if the player action is 'captured' or 'destroyed a Resonator on'.

5. field.py

    Fetch all the portals in one tilekey, and refresh the capture status.

## HOWTO
You can specify the max/min lat/lng (ex, your city), and then use linux crontab to run the scripts timely like this:

0 */3 * * * /usr/bin/python /root/refreshCookies.py >> /root/refreshCookies.log 2>&1

*/2 * * * * /usr/bin/python /root/comm.py >> /root/comm.log 2>&1

*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/python /root/calculateTilekeys.py >> /root/caltilekey.log 2>&1

*/30 * * * * /usr/bin/python /root/field.py >> /root/field.log 2>&1

*/30 * * * * /usr/bin/python /root/refreshPortals.py >> /root/refreshPortals.log 2>&1

As of now the scripts need database connection and don't have and UI. Maybe later I will try to do some coding for the UI part.
Hope you have a nice day with this script.
